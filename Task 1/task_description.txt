    Design a class BankAccount that represents a bank account with basic functionalities. Your BankAccount class should have the following features:
    Attributes:
    account_number: A unique identifier for the account (integer).
    account_holder_name: Name of the account holder (string).
    balance: The current balance in the account (float).

    Methods:
    deposit(amount): Add a specified amount to the balance.
    withdraw(amount): Subtract a specified amount from the balance (if sufficient funds are available).
    get_balance(): Return the current balance of the account.
    get_account_info(): Return a string summarizing the account details (account number, account holder name, and balance).
    
    Additional Requirements:
      Ensure that the withdraw method only allows withdrawal if the balance is sufficient.
      Provide a constructor to initialize the account number, account holder name, and initial balance.

    Example:
      Account Holder: John Doe
      Account Number: 123456
      Balance: 1000.50
      
      After Deposit: 200.00
      New Balance: 1200.50
      
      After Withdrawal: 500.00
      New Balance: 700.50
